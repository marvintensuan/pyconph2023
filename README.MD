# Abstract

This talk is about Jupyter Notebooks, particularly the output component of its cells.

Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab are widely regarded as platforms for data exploration. But it has definitely grown past this use. I will explore in this talk the ways I did to make notebook files a reader-friendly tool for communication.

The session will be geared towards beginners and can be conducted ideally from 15 to 30 minutes.

# Objectives

At the end of this session, the audience would be able to:

- hopefully and especially for non-web developers, appreciate HTML and CSS.
- for aspiring library authors to be inspired in improving developer experience for all.

As a speaker, I aim to:

- promote the use of Jupyter Notebooks outside of data science.
- advocate for formal use of Jupyter Notebooks outside of data exploration.
